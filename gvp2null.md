# Making nulls!

This describes how to run the program: gvp2null.py


## Program requirements
This script is written in Python (3.*), and it has no special libraries.
For input: it requires the predicted protein products from some exome/genome sequencing project. Only [bcftools csq](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#csq) (version 1.9-197-g4e51a29) is supported, though more recent versions likely work.
